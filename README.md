# PersonalWebstite

A interactive website to get to know me, Jessica Clark!

This website is a personal project created by yours truly, Jessica Clark. The main objective of this site is to introduce myself through interactive means as we all know that regular resumes can be tedious. This is also a way to expand on who I am with my interests and characteristics. I wanted to make this so I can explore my skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript as I work full-time during college.
